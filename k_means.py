# 1. Create synthetic dataset
""" 500 sample points, arranged around 1 center so the clusters are not clearly 
outlined. The random_state=42 argument seeds the generator to keep the output 
deterministic across runs. The function returns a feature matrix X, containing 
the coordinates of every sampled point, and y_true, an array of integers that 
mark the ground-truth cluster assignment for evaluation or visualization. """

# 2. Train K-Means model
""" instantiates a KMeans clustering model with 4 centroid slots, a deterministic 
random seed of 42, and scikit-learnâ€™s modern default for the repeated 
initialization strategy (n_init="auto"). The second line passes the feature
matrix X into fit_predict, which both trains the model and returns the cluster
labels assigned to each sample; the result is stored in y_kmeans for later 
evaluation or visualization.
